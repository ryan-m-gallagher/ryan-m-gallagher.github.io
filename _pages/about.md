I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, Illinois.  My primary fields of specialization are urban/regional economics and local public finance.  I am an applied microeconomist and my most recent research focuses on the fiscal and socio-economic effects of redistributive property taxation, urban land-use regulation, and income segregation.  I also like to dabble a bit in urban economic history; some of my current research investigates the long-run socio-economic impacts of suburban land-use controls and suburban municipal annexation decisons made during the early post-WWII era.

I have a wide range of teaching interests.  Beyond core micro-thoeory courses, I teach classes in urban economics, regional economic development/growth, cost-benefit analysis, and public-sector economics.  I also teach a first-term micro-theory course for the University of Illinois at Chicago's Department of Economics as part of their Applied M.A. in Economics program.

Prior to entering academia I was a Research Economist for the Illinois Department of Revenue where I conducted economic impact and revenue analysis.  I live in Chicago, Illinois with my two wonderful children and amazing wife.
